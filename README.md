# Snyk Vulnerability Scanning and Summary Reporting with GitHub Actions

## Overview

This project integrates Snyk security scanning into a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow. It automatically scans the codebase for vulnerabilities and generates both a detailed JSON report and a simplified human-readable summary. The reports are committed to the repository and uploaded as artifacts for easy access.

## Features

- Automated security scanning using the Snyk CLI
- JSON output of all detected vulnerabilities
- Python-based summary generator that creates a readable report
- Upload of both raw and summary reports as GitHub Actions artifacts
- Auto-commit of generated reports to the repository

## Workflow Details

The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on every push to the `master` branch and includes the following steps:

1. Checkout the repository
2. Install the latest Snyk CLI
3. Run `snyk test` to scan the project and export results as `snyk-results.json`
4. Upload the JSON report as a workflow artifact
5. Set up Python environment
6. Run the summary script (`summarize_snyk_report.py`) to generate `snyk-summary.txt`
7. Upload the summary as a second artifact
8. Commit both reports to the repository (if changed)

Requirements
Python 3.x

Snyk CLI

GitHub Actions enabled in the repository

A valid Snyk token stored as a repository secret (SNYK_TOKEN)

Output
snyk-results.json: Raw JSON results from the Snyk scan

snyk-summary.txt: Clean, readable summary of vulnerabilities by severity and fix availability
